Hello. Hi. Welcome
Uhh
I have never run this outside of VS code.
*Technically* I didn't make this, just a lil fun I had with copilot. 
If you read this, what the hell you doing here? I put this here so I can not worry 24/7 about accidentally deleting it, and so I can show it to a friend who lives accross the ocean.

If you wanna try, just use streamlit run dashboard.py and then you'll be able to have an existential crisis over bad code.
